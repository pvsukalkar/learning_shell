TO DO and NOT TO DOs in shell: 
1) Keep big files in mind: 
	`sed -n '1p' file` --> prints the first line of file but reads the whole file, so if file is huge there would be performance issue 
	`sed -n '1p;1q' file` --> reads first line and quits file. Thus no performance issue even for huge files. 
	
	So choose your commands wisely.
	
2) Try different ways: 
 a) if [ $? -eq 0 ] then    echo "Success" fi
   can be replaced by 
   [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "Success" 
   
 b) Files transferred from windows to linux have ^M (Ctrl+M) character at end of each line. To remove this use any of following commands : 
   i) dos2unix file 
   ii) tr -d '^M' <file > file2
		mv file2 file1 
   iii) sed -i 's/^M//g' file
   iv) using vi editor 
   :%s/^M//
   v) awk 'sub(/^M/,"");1' file
   vi) perl -pi -e 's/^M//g' file 
   
  c) Evaluating arithmetic expression: 
   i) use expr: 
    --> x=3 ; y=4 ; expr $x + $y 
   ii) use bc : 
    --> echo $x + $y | bc 
   iii) ((...)) notation 
    --> echo $(($x + $y))
   iv ) let : 
    --> let z=x+y      // Note that $ is not used with variable names  
        echo $z 		
   v) awk : 
   --> echo "" | awk '{print '$x' + '$y'}'
   
  d)
