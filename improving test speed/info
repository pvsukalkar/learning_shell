Pass any file name as parameter to this script. 
It will create and open the file with 'file name' in vi editor.
If it is shell file it will add '#!/bin/sh'
for C file : '#include <stdio.h>' and so on..
Then once you made changes to this file, it will automatically change it to executable and run it.
After seeing the output, you might notice some errors so this script will automatically open your 
file for editing in vi editor. 

Thus, in short it accelerates process of opening file, creating template , running it and again opening to fix errors.
